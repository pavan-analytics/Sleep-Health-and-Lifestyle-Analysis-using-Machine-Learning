# Sleep-Health-and-Lifestyle-Analysis-using-Machine-Learning

An end-to-end machine learning project that explores how lifestyle habits impact sleep health by building predictive models. This project demonstrates the complete ML workflow using Python, focusing on data preparation, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation to predict sleep quality.

üìå Project Overview
This project aims to:

Prepare and preprocess real-world health and lifestyle data for machine learning

Engineer features relevant to sleep quality prediction

Train and evaluate classification/regression models to predict sleep quality or duration

Generate actionable insights from the predictive models to support better sleep health

Ideal for data scientists and health researchers interested in predictive analytics for sleep behavior.

üß∞ Tools & Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

üöÄ Machine Learning Pipeline
1. Data Loading & Preprocessing
Handle missing values via imputation or removal

Encode categorical variables (e.g., stress levels, occupation)

Normalize or scale numerical features as needed

2. Feature Engineering
Derive new variables such as BMI categories, stress indicators

Categorize sleep quality into classes (e.g., Good, Moderate, Poor)

Select features relevant for prediction through correlation analysis or feature importance

3. Model Selection & Training
Split dataset into training and test sets

Train classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)

Optionally, regression models to predict sleep duration (e.g., Linear Regression, XGBoost)

4. Model Evaluation
Evaluate using appropriate metrics:

Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

Regression: RMSE, MAE, R¬≤ score

Perform hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV

Cross-validation to ensure model robustness

5. Interpretation & Insights
Analyze feature importance to understand key factors impacting sleep quality

Visualize model performance and confusion matrices

üìä Results
Predictive models achieved [90]% accuracy in classifying sleep quality.

Stress levels, physical activity, and BMI emerged as top predictors.

Models demonstrate potential to forecast sleep health and guide lifestyle interventions.

üîÆ Future Enhancements
Integrate more advanced ML techniques like deep learning or ensemble stacking

Incorporate additional health parameters (diet, caffeine intake, heart rate variability)

Deploy model as a REST API or integrate into a sleep tracking app

Automate data pipeline for real-time sleep quality prediction
