## üìä Project Steps

### 1. Set Up the Environment
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Python, 
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

### 2. Load and Explore the Dataset
- Source: Health and Sleep Survey Data
- Initial Exploration: Data types, missing values, and descriptive stats

### 3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Remove duplicates and handle missing values
- Normalize data formats (e.g., categorical labels)
- Convert appropriate fields to numeric

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Categorize sleep quality
- Create BMI indicators and stress categories if needed
- Correlation matrix and derived metrics

### 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Relationship between stress, physical activity, and sleep
- Visualization of average sleep across different occupations
- Identify top factors influencing poor/good sleep

### 6. Insights & Recommendations
- High stress = low sleep quality
- Active lifestyle promotes better sleep
- Occupation plays a role in sleep duration

---

## üìå Results and Insights

- **Stress Management:** High stress strongly correlates with poor sleep.
- **Physical Activity:** Positive impact on both sleep quality and duration.
- **Occupation Impact:** Certain jobs showed significantly lower sleep averages.
- **Health Metrics:** Heart rate and BMI categories also influence sleep quality.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- Add machine learning model to predict sleep quality
- Integrate additional health parameters (e.g., diet, caffeine intake)

---

## üìö Acknowledgments

- Dataset Source: Public health dataset on sleep and lifestyle
- Inspired by real-world applications of health and wellness analytics
